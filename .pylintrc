# Python code to execute, usually for sys.path manipulation such as
# pygtk.require().

# Add files or directories to the blacklist. They should be base names, not
# paths.

# Pickle collected data for later comparisons.

[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Enable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You can
# either give multiple identifier separated by comma (,) or put this option
# multiple time. See also the "--disable" option for examples.
#enable=

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once).You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use"--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W"
disable=

[REPORTS]

# Set the output format. Available formats are text, parseable, colorized, msvs
# (visual studio) and html. You can also give a reporter class, eg
# mypackage.mymodule.MyReporterClass.
output-format=colorized

# Put messages in a separate file for each module / package specified on the
# command line instead of printing them on stdout. Reports (if any) will be
# written in a file name "pylint_global.[txt|html]".
files-output=no

# Tells whether to display a full report or only the messages
reports=no

# Python expression which should return a note less than 10 (10 is the highest
# note). You have access to the variables errors warning, statement which
# respectively contain the number of errors / warnings messages and the total
# number of statements analyzed. This is used by the global evaluation report
# (RP0004).
evaluation=10.0 - ((float(5 * error + warning + refactor + convention) / statement) * 10)

# Template used to display messages. This is a python new-style format string
# used to format the message information. See doc for all details
